            "thoughts": "So I'm starting a dev dairy; probably should have started it sooner. Like, way back in May of last year. But I'm starting it now. I figured it would be good typing practice,give me a way to document my proccess, and work through what I'm thinking to hopefully make better progress and prevent myself from staying stuck on something. \nAnd hopefully keep me comitted to this site.\nAnyway, I made a to-do list in my journal and drew out what I want the next version of the landing page to look like. I was thinking about how to make the page feel a little bit more like me; give it my \"voice\", so to speak. Including headers that felt more like my speaking and having fun little hand written notes felt like a good way to do it. The page is also going to be taking inspiration from Google's Material Design with each section being a seperate sort of tab that has pockets to other links. Maybe once I have everything layed out I'll also incorparate gentle gradients. We will see.\nNow I am trying to figure out how to do a mosaic layout for my art and deseign pages. It's a layout I've done in the past, but I feel like I can simplify the code side for this project. The real issue is taking that first step to go re-write the code and styling that I've already done for a flex-box based design. It will be worth it in the end, though. I'm sure of it.\nI really need to solve the cors errors first."

            "thoughts": "There wasn't an entry the past couple days because I wanted to play some video games. That being said, I did get a start on the mosaic tiling for the art and design pages. Hopefully most of the logic I wrote on the 30th is functional and I just need to work through the current errors to see. Based on what I'm seeing in the console, there appears to be a race condition thats causeing my grid array to be referenced before it gets populated with \"false\"s. I decided that fixing that was less important than playing Clone Hero with my buddy, which was also more important than writing an entry for that day. \n As for yesterday, I got paid and started playing the new Jedi series; so yeah, no work on the site.../nso it turned out that the grid just wasn't big enough for all of the items. Finding the problems that are now proven to be in the logic is a problem for future Jack."
